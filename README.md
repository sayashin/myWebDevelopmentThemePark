# web-dev-team-38
Repo for development of team 38 Web Development project.


### Discussion to date

All documents can be found in the docs folder, including drafts.

We have discussed a number of themes, including:
* Web Dev
* Space
* Anime/Manga - Selected

We have decided as a team to use the anime/manga theme for our website. It is the subject that, on average, we are most comfortable with.

We are mostly in agreement that our three pages should include a Home page that shows featured rides, special events and limited time pricing as well as navigation for the rest of the site.

Our other two pages should include lists of all attractions and other services offered at the park and another page for the purchase of tickets. Both pages should include detailed information regarding their respective content.

We have created a number of sample wireframes and have narrowed down a design that meets our requirements at this time. We will continue to adapt the wireframes through each part of the assignent as we continue to develop the web site.

### Folder structure

Currently, in our top level folder we have our 'docs' folder containing written documentation and wireframes. There will also be the 'src' folder which will contain the web site source files, including images and stylesheets in the appropriate folders.
We have created a number of sample wireframes and have not yet decided on a final wireframe for the layout of the site.

### Branch rule
* Main branch --> Branch for assignment submission so we can submit this branch for each assignment.

* Develop branch --> Main branch when we work so we can push to this branch when we finish own work.

* Feature branch --> Working branch. This branch should be created based on develop.
